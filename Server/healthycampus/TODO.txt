Check in:

	do something if it took too long to checkin
	modify the points system based on some sort of variables such as speed, correct kiosk etc
	
	for file checkins: add points, correct kiosks?

	
	 maybe instead of throwing away cheating attempts, log it in its own table so can see users 'cheating' logs?
	
add way for multiple devices (make a device model and foreign key it to user)
	
nice to have: 
	sick graph page
	user_details_search.html and kiosk.html need stuff
	
BUGS:
	lots of 'profiles' arent being pulled when displaying their profile, due to a get problem
